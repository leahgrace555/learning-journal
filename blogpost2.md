# What is a Text Editor?
A text editor is software that allows you to manage text, especially text involved with building websites. 
There are many different text editors available and understanding the different features will help you pick the right one for your needs. 

## What features should you look for in a text editor?

 - **Code completion:** a feature that will show suggestions to finish commands based on what you have already typed. This can help save time and avoid possible typos. 

- **Syntax highlighting:** This feature takes your text and colorizes it based on whether it is an attribute, element, etc… This makes code easier to read and can help you spot errors much faster.

- **Themes:** This allows you to change your background and text colors. Devs spend many hours looking at screens and choosing a theme that reduces eye strain for you is important.  

- **Extensions:** These are add-on features that allow you to do things you normally wouldn’t without them. Good text editors will have a great selection of extensions for you to take advantage of.
