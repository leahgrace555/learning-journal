# What is a Text Editor?
A text editor is software that allows you to manage text, especially text involved with building websites. 
There are many different text editors available and understanding the different features will help you pick the right one for your needs. 

## What features should you look for in a text editor?

 - **Code completion:** a feature that will show suggestions to finish commands based on what you have already typed. This can help save time and avoid possible typos. 

- **Syntax highlighting:** This feature takes your text and colorizes it based on whether it is an attribute, element, etc… This makes code easier to read and can help you spot errors much faster.

- **Themes:** This allows you to change your background and text colors. Devs spend many hours looking at screens and choosing a theme that reduces eye strain for you is important.  

- **Extensions:** These are add-on features that allow you to do things you normally wouldn’t without them. Good text editors will have a great selection of extensions for you to take advantage of. 


## Terminal Cheat Sheet

### 1. Paths
- Two types of paths: absolute and relative
- abosulte paths Absolute paths specify a file location with respect to the root directory
- Relative paths specify a file in relation to where you are currently located in the file system. 

Some examples are as follows:

1.  ~(tilde) shortcut for the home directory eg. /home/me/documents = ~/documents
2.  .(dot) refers to the current location eg ./documents
3.  ..(dot dot) references a parent directory



### Useful Commands

- **Shortcut History:** Tapping the up arrow in some terminals can cycle through a list of commands you have previously used. 
- **pwd:** Print working directory. This shows you your current location in the file system. This is important since certain commands will only work if you are in the correct location. It can run without any arguments.
- **ls:** Short for list
- **cd:** Is used to move locations. (short for change directory). When run without arguments it will take you to the home directory. For example, cd ~/Documents will take you to /Home/Me/Documents
