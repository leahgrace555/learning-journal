# JavaScript

## Objectives and Methods

Script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 

Each step is known as a **statement**

Things to note:
-JavaScript is ***case sensitive***
- Each statement should start on a new line and end with a semicolon
- Statements can be organize into code blocks with curly brackets. 

### Comments

Comments can be single line or multiline
- Add a single line comment with two forward slashes // --anything after the slashes on that line will be interpreted as a comment
- Add a multiline comment by surrounding the text with /* text goes here
and also here */

## Variables

Before you can use variables, you must declare that you want to use them them with a statement such as: ` var quantity; ` where "var" is the variable keyword and "quantity" is the variable name. Multi-word variables must be written in camelCase

Once you create a variable, you can assign it a value. For example, ` quantity = 3; ` is how we assign a value to the variable we created in the previous example.

There are three types of data

1. Numeric data consists of numbers
2. String data consists of letters and other characters
3. Boolean data can have one of two values, true or false

There are six rules you must always follow when naming variables:

1. Names must begin with a letter, dollar sign or underscone. Never a number. 
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign or underscores. Do not use a dash or dot in a variable name
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words
4. Variables are case sensitive
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information the variable stores
6. When using mutiple words in a variable, type in camelCase, or use underscores instead of spaces. 

## Arrays

Arrays are a set of values that are related to each other.This may be used in place of a long list of variables. 

example:

````
var colors;
colors = ['white','black','custom'];
````
Values in array are given an index, or number that can be used to reference. Note that **index values start at 0, not 1**
