## What Is The Growth Mindset? 
The growth mindset is the belief that goals are acheived through effort and perserverence, while talent is simply a starting point. 

According to [this](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) article by Steve Haffenden,
>  *"A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning. By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort."*

## How Do I Stay in the Growth Mindset?

### 1. Embrace challenges.
And remember that challenges are what help you grow

### 2. Criticism (if it's constructive) should not be ignored
Chances are, people who offer constructive criticism are looking out for you and want to see you improve

### 3. Others' success should be an inspiration
Not a threat. Remember that successful colleagues and peers may have valuable insights that can help you succeed as well.
