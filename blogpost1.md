# What I've Learned

Markdown is a relatively simple way to change the styling of text on a webpage.
For example, you can make text look like:
- **This** by typing ` **this** `
- Or *this* by typing ` *this* `

It also took me a little while to figure out that surrounding code with backticks is how you add the raw code to a webpage. 
Seeing "Type *this* to make it look like *this* on the rendered webpage wasn't very helpful. 

Some other helpful styling methods using GitHub Markdown are listed below. 

## Headers

You may have noticed that this header is smaller than the one at the top of the page. How did I do that? 

# This the Biggest Header 
and 
###### This is the smallest header

Headers are added using:

````
# For the Biggest 
## For the next biggest
etc... until we get to 
###### For the smallest 
````


## Lists

There are two types of lists that can be added. Lists are either ordered or unordered. 

Create an ordered list like this:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2 
3. Item #
4. Etc..

by typing:

````
1. Item 1
2. Item 2 
3. Item #
4. Etc..
````

And create an unordered List like this:

* Thing 1 
* Thing 2
* Thing 3
* And that other thing

By typing:
````
* Thing 1 
* Thing 2
* Thing 3
* And that other thing
````
