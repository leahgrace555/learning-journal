# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators

These evaluate situations by comparing a value in the script to what one may expect it to be, returning a boolean of True or False.

| Operator | Meaning        | Use      |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| ==       | Is Equal to    | Returns a value of true of the two values are the same|
| ===     | Is Strictly Equal to | Returns true of the values AND data types are the same|
| !=     | Is not Equal to | Returns a value of true if the values are NOT the same |
|!==     | Is Strictly Not Equal to | Returns a value of true if the values AND data types are not the same |
| <      | Is less than | Check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right| 
| >       | Is greater than | Check if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right|
| <=    | Less than or equal to |  Check if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right |
| >=   | Greater than or equal to | Check if the value on th left is greater than or equal to the value on the left |
| && | Logical And | Tests more than one condition, and returns true only if both conditions are true |
| \|\| | Logical Or | Tests more than one condition and returns true if one of the conditions is true|
| ! | Logical Not | Takes a boolean and inverts it

## Loops

Loops check a condition and if that condition returns true, it will run a block of code, repeating until the condition returns false

**For** Loops: These run for a specified number of times.

**While** Loops: These run as long as the condition is true.

**Do While** Loops: These are similar to while loops, but will always run the code block inside the curly brackets at least once.
