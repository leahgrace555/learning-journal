# A Guide to Git

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (or DVCS for short) that stores versions of files as snapshots each time you save changes, or "commit", a project. Git tracks changes made to files or directories and is set up to minimize the possibility of damage to files and data loss. 

Files in Git reside in three main states:
- ***Committed*** files are securely stores in a local database
- ***Modified*** files are files that have been changed but not committed to the database. 
- ***Staged*** files are files that flagged to commit the changed version to the next snapshot
