# How computers work

All information stored and processed in computers in represented using electricity. How is this done?

## Binary Number System
- The smallest unit of information a computer deals with is a "bit" 
- Computers operate using a binary number system, which uses only 1 and 0
- All information types like text, images and sound can all be represented by numbers
- Text can be represented through numbers by assigning values to letters
- Pictures can be represented through numbers by assigning color values to individual pixels on a screen

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output
All computers perform the same 4 basic functions
1. Input information
2. Store information
3. Process information
4. Output information

**Input** devices convert physical input to binary. These are things like keyboards, mice, microphone, camera, etc..

**Memeory** devices store that infomration.

**Central Processing Unit** or CPU performs all the calculations.

**Output** devices take that information and convert it to physical output. These are devices such as speakers or screens.

## Hardware and Software
Hardware are the physical components of a computer, while the software is all the programming that runs it. How do these two things interact with one another?

- CPU is a master chip that controls all parts of the computer
- The CPU receives signals and "knows" which circuits to use to complete a job
- Modern programming languages use a more user-friendly interface to write code, but is all backed by binary
- The master program that controls how computer software uses the computer hardware is called the **operating system**
